# Fabest blog

## About this project

This blog is a SPA with a minimalist design. It has a start page with some featured posts, a page with all posts, a detail page with adding and displaying comments, and a contact page with a form.
[See the page](https://fabest.vercel.app/)

I'm going to add the following features:

- categories of posts, the ability to select a specific category,
- only last 5 comments to start, all comments only after button click,
- tests for the contact form and for adding comments
